// Function to extract experience level using DeepSeek web search - CONTENT ONLY
async function extractExperienceFromJobLink(jobLink, maxRetries = 3) {
    const prompt = `You have web search capabilities. Please search for and analyze the job posting at this URL: ${jobLink}

Your task is to find the experience level requirements for this job posting by analyzing ONLY the actual job posting content. Look for:
- Years of experience required (e.g., "3+ years", "minimum 5 years", "2-4 years")
- Seniority level indicators in the job description (e.g., "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Entry-level", "Mid-level")
- Any specific experience requirements mentioned in the job description
- Salary ranges that indicate experience level (higher salaries typically indicate more senior roles)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze ONLY the job posting content, not the URL or website structure
- Consider salary ranges as indicators of experience level
- Look for technical skill requirements that suggest experience level
- Do NOT make assumptions based on URL paths or website context

Based on your analysis, classify the experience level into one of these bins:
- Entry (0-2 Years)
- Mid (3-5 Years) 
- Senior (6-8 Years)
- Lead (8+ Years)

Experience level mapping rules:
‚Ä¢ "1+ years" or "minimum 1 year" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ "2+ years" or "minimum 2 years" = Mid (3-5 Years)
‚Ä¢ "5+ years" or "minimum 5 years" = Senior (6-8 Years)
‚Ä¢ "8+ years" or "minimum 8 years" = Lead (8+ Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Senior", "Lead", "Principal" = Senior (6-8 Years) or Lead (8+ Years) ONLY if content supports it
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Entry", "Junior", "Associate" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Mid", "Intermediate" = Mid (3-5 Years)
‚Ä¢ "Staff" positions can vary - analyze based on requirements and salary
‚Ä¢ "Product Manager" typically indicates Mid to Senior level

Salary range indicators:
‚Ä¢ $50,000-$70,000 = typically Entry level
‚Ä¢ $70,000-$100,000 = typically Mid level  
‚Ä¢ $100,000-$150,000 = typically Senior level
‚Ä¢ $150,000+ = typically Lead level

If no clear experience requirement is found, return null.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format (no markdown formatting, no code blocks):
{
  "job_link": "${jobLink}",
  "experience_level": "[Entry (0-2 Years)/Mid (3-5 Years)/Senior (6-8 Years)/Lead (8+ Years)/null]",
  "found_requirements": "[brief description of what experience requirements were found in the actual job content]",
  "confidence": "[high/medium/low]"
