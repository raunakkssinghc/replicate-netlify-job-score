async function extractExperienceFromJobLink(jobLink, maxRetries = 3) {
    const prompt = `You have web search capabilities. Please search for and analyze the job posting at this URL: ${jobLink}

Your task is to find the experience level requirements for this job posting. Look for:
- Years of experience required (e.g., "3+ years", "minimum 5 years", "2-4 years")
- Seniority level indicators in the ACTUAL job description (e.g., "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Entry-level", "Mid-level")
- Any specific experience requirements mentioned in the job description

CRITICAL: Only analyze the actual job posting content. Do NOT use URL context or assumptions about the website structure. Focus ONLY on what is explicitly stated in the job description.

Based on your analysis, classify the experience level into one of these bins:
- Entry (0-2 Years)
- Mid (3-5 Years) 
- Senior (6-8 Years)
- Lead (8+ Years)

Experience level mapping rules:
‚Ä¢ "1+ years" or "minimum 1 year" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ "2+ years" or "minimum 2 years" = Mid (3-5 Years)
‚Ä¢ "5+ years" or "minimum 5 years" = Senior (6-8 Years)
‚Ä¢ "8+ years" or "minimum 8 years" = Lead (8+ Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Senior", "Lead", "Principal" = Senior (6-8 Years) or Lead (8+ Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Entry", "Junior", "Associate" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Mid", "Intermediate" = Mid (3-5 Years)

If no clear experience requirement is found, return null.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format (no markdown formatting, no code blocks):
{
  "job_link": "${jobLink}",
  "experience_level": "[Entry (0-2 Years)/Mid (3-5 Years)/Senior (6-8 Years)/Lead (8+ Years)/null]",
  "found_requirements": "[brief description of what experience requirements were found in the actual job content]",
  "confidence": "[high/medium/low]"
}`;
