async function extractExperienceFromJobLink(jobLink, maxRetries = 3) {

Your task is to find the experience level requirements for this job posting. Look for:
- Years of experience required (e.g., "3+ years", "minimum 5 years", "2-4 years")
- Seniority level indicators (e.g., "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Entry-level", "Mid-level")
- Any specific experience requirements mentioned in the job description

Based on your analysis, classify the experience level into one of these bins:
- Entry (0-2 Years)
- Mid (3-5 Years) 
- Senior (6-8 Years)
- Lead (8+ Years)

Experience level mapping rules:
‚Ä¢ "1+ years" or "minimum 1 year" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ "2+ years" or "minimum 2 years" = Mid (3-5 Years)
‚Ä¢ "5+ years" or "minimum 5 years" = Senior (6-8 Years)
‚Ä¢ "8+ years" or "minimum 8 years" = Lead (8+ Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Senior", "Lead", "Principal" = Senior (6-8 Years) or Lead (8+ Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Entry", "Junior", "Associate" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Mid", "Intermediate" = Mid (3-5 Years)
‚Ä¢ "Summer Associate" typically indicates Entry (0-2 Years) - internship/entry level

If no clear experience requirement is found, return null.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "job_link": "${jobLink}",
  "experience_level": "[Entry (0-2 Years)/Mid (3-5 Years)/Senior (6-8 Years)/Lead (8+ Years)/null]",
  "found_requirements": "[brief description of what experience requirements were found]",
  "confidence": "[high/medium/low]"
}`;
