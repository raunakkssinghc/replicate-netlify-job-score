// Function to test job title cleaning
async function testJobTitleCleaning(jobLink, expectedTitle, maxRetries = 3) {
    const prompt = `You have web search capabilities. Please search for and analyze the job posting at this URL: ${jobLink}

Your task is to find the experience level requirements for this job posting by analyzing ONLY the actual job posting content. Look for:
- Years of experience required (e.g., "3+ years", "minimum 5 years", "2-4 years")
- Seniority level indicators in the job description (e.g., "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Entry-level", "Mid-level")
- Any specific experience requirements mentioned in the job description
- Salary ranges that indicate experience level (higher salaries typically indicate more senior roles)

JOB TITLE CLEANING RULES:
- Remove: Company names, geographic locations, department prefixes (e.g., "USA - EY-Parthenon - Corporate Finance -")
- Keep: Product team names (e.g., "Google Fi and Store", "Payments Team")
- Keep: Core role title (e.g., "Data Engineer", "Quantitative Finance")
- Keep: Technical focus areas (e.g., "Infrastructure", "Backend", "Frontend") 
- Keep: Seniority indicators (e.g., "Senior", "Lead", "Principal")
- Keep: Specialization areas that affect requirements (e.g., "Economics", "Machine Learning")

Examples:
- "Data Engineer, Google Fi and Store, Infrastructure" ‚Üí "Data Engineer, Google Fi and Store, Infrastructure" (keep all)
- "USA - EY-Parthenon - Corporate Finance - Quantitative Finance and Economics" ‚Üí "Quantitative Finance and Economics" (remove company prefix)
- "Senior Software Engineer, Backend, Payments Team" ‚Üí "Senior Software Engineer, Backend, Payments Team" (keep all)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze ONLY the job posting content, not the URL or website structure
- If the job title says "Senior" but the content says "entry-level", trust the content over the title
- If the job title says "Senior" and the content supports senior-level requirements, classify as Senior
- Do NOT make assumptions based on URL paths or website context

Based on your analysis, classify the experience level into one of these bins:
- Entry (0-2 Years)
- Mid (3-5 Years) 
- Senior (6-8 Years)
- Lead (8+ Years)

Experience level mapping rules:
‚Ä¢ "1+ years" or "minimum 1 year" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ "2+ years" or "minimum 2 years" = Mid (3-5 Years)
‚Ä¢ "5+ years" or "minimum 5 years" = Senior (6-8 Years)
‚Ä¢ "8+ years" or "minimum 8 years" = Lead (8+ Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Senior", "Lead", "Principal" = Senior (6-8 Years) or Lead (8+ Years) ONLY if content supports it
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Entry", "Junior", "Associate" = Entry (0-2 Years)
‚Ä¢ Job titles with "Mid", "Intermediate" = Mid (3-5 Years)

If no clear experience requirement is found, return null.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format (no markdown formatting, no code blocks):
{
  "job_link": "${jobLink}",
  "job_title": "[cleaned job title following the rules above]",
  "experience_level": "[Entry (0-2 Years)/Mid (3-5 Years)/Senior (6-8 Years)/Lead (8+ Years)/null]",
  "found_requirements": "[brief description of what experience requirements were found in the actual job content]",
  "confidence": "[high/medium/low]"
